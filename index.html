            <p>Hello, my name is Spencer Flores, I'm from Lima, Peru. 
                I really enjoy riding my bike and traveling to many places in my country. 
                I studied Business Administration as my first degree, and now I'm studying Software Development.
                My entire family is a member of the church; my parents are returned missionaries, as are all my siblings except the youngest, who is preparing to serve in one. 
                I served a mission in Santa Fe, Argentina, from 2017 to 2019.
                I like to constantly learn new knowledge to obtain skills that help me continue progressing both spiritually and temporally.
                I want to learn a lot about the career I am currently studying because, if I can apply each of the topics learned, I will be able to excel in the future in the job I can get, contributing positively to my personal and family self-sufficiency, and later, to my future family.</p>

            <p>Lima, the capital of Peru, is located on the country's arid Pacific coast. Although its colonial center is preserved, it is a bustling metropolis and one of the largest cities in South America. It is home to the pre-Columbian art collection of the Larco Museum and the National Museum, which traces the history of the ancient civilizations of Peru. The Plaza de Armas and the 16th-century cathedral are the heart of the old Center of Lima.</p>
