        <p>Hello, my name is Spencer Flores, I'm from Lima, Peru. 
            I really enjoy riding my bike and traveling to many places in my country. 
            I studied Business Administration as my first degree, and now I'm studying Software Development.
            My entire family is a member of the church, my parents are returned missionaries as are all my siblings except the youngest, who is preparing to serve in one. 
            I served the mission in Santa Fe - Argentina from 2017 to 2019.
            I like to constantly learn new knowledge in order to obtain skills that help me continue progressing both spiritually and temporally.
            I want to learn a lot about the career I am currently studying because, if I can apply each of the topics learned there, I will be able to excel in the future in the job I can get, to be able to contribute positively to my personal and family self-sufficiency, and later, in my future family.</p>

        <img src="images/lima.jpg" alt="Lima landscape">
        <p>Lima, the capital of Peru, is located on the country's arid Pacific coast. Although its colonial center is preserved, it is a bustling metropolis and one of the largest cities in South America. It is home to the pre-Columbian art collection of the Larco Museum and the National Museum, which traces the history of the ancient civilizations of Peru. The Plaza de Armas and the 16th century cathedral are the heart of the old Center of Lima.</p>
