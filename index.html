        <p>Hello, my name is Spencer Flores, I'm from Lima, Peru. 
            I really enjoy riding my bike and traveling to many places in my country. 
            I studied Business Administration as my first degree, and now I'm studying Software Development.</p>

        <img src="images/lima.jpg" alt="Lima landscape">
        <p>Lima, the capital of Peru, is located on the country's arid Pacific coast. Although its colonial center is preserved, it is a bustling metropolis and one of the largest cities in South America. It is home to the pre-Columbian art collection of the Larco Museum and the National Museum, which traces the history of the ancient civilizations of Peru. The Plaza de Armas and the 16th century cathedral are the heart of the old Center of Lima.</p>
